## Project Overview
This project not only explores the technical aspects of machine learning in sports analytics but also taps into the cultural and social significance of Olympic predictions. 
The project is implemented in Python using the libraries PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas and SciKit-Learn.

## Installation

Our project is fully integrated in a Jupyter Notebook. See `PredictingParis2024.ipynb`.

### Prerequisites
|Library         | Version |
|--------------------|----|
|`Python`| `3.6.13 (Anaconda3)`|
|`matplotlib`| `3.7.4`|
|`numpy`| `1.26.4`|
|`openCV`| `4.10.0`|
## Data

### Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction steps are detailed in the notebook.
- Ensure that the data has been loaded into your Jupyter workspace.

## Algorithm

### Key Hyperparameters

## Results

## Usage

To use the model for predictions:

1. **Ensure that the data is in place.**

2. **Run the notebook**: Open the `UniqueGroupParsingCSV_Final.ipynb` and follow the instructions to generate predictions.
   
3. **Run the notebook**: Open the `SlowFastActionRecognition.ipynb` and follow the instructions to generate predictions.
